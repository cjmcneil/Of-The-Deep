Instructions: 
    The game begins with the submarine at the top of the ocean’s surface, but it immediately submerges and keeps on going down a sunlit underwater trench.    
    At the top right of the screen are two meters: a health meter and a fossil meter. 
    Similar to our first workshop, the background is always moving up, giving the illusion that our submarine is going deeper.

    Players must be careful to avoid the sides of the trench, as well as sharks which, if the player gets too close to them, will pursue them until they reach the top of the screen and disappear. 
    The submarine has no weapons, so all the player can do is use the WASD keys to avoid enemies. 
    Colliding with hazards results in a depletion of the health bar, and once it reaches zero, the lose screen (a black screen with a few bubbles and a ‘You Lose’ message) appears. 

    Also scattered throughout the first of our two levels are a plethora of fossils, which raise the fossil meter when collided with. 
    When the fossil meter is maxed out, all sharks will disappear and the submarine will enter the next level.
    
    The next (and final) level takes place in the dark seabed of the trench. 
    There is no fossil meter this time, just the health bar. 
    The objective is to find the egg. However, as the player explores, they will encounter a fully-grown aquasaurus, which will pursue them and try to consume the submarine. 
    The player’s only hope is to find and collide with the egg at the seabed, whereupon the aquasaurus will disappear and the submarine will rise to the surface. 
    The win screen is then shown, which depicts the submarine sailing on the surface towards land - until the aquasaurus rises from underneath and swallows it whole.
